= Wi-Fi Occupancy Sensor

The goal of this project is to create an enchanced occupancy sensor for HacDC. The idea is that by monitoring DHCP requests on the Wi-Fi network we can determine when people are in the space, approximately how many people may be in the space, and possibly even which people are in the space.

It is currently being developed and run on a Raspberry Pi Model B+.
